# # MatchVariables
#
#
# MatchVariables() ensures that the columns in the test set are identical to those
# in the train set.
#
# If the test set contains additional columns, they are dropped. Alternatively, if the
# test set lacks columns that were present in the train set, they will be added with a
# value determined by the user, for example np.nan.

# Note how the columns that were present in the test set but not in train set were dropped. And now, the missing variables were added back into the dataset with the value 0.
